Results attached in best_hospitals_results excel workbook.

Hospitals were ranked in order of highest average score in order to determine the 10 best hospitals.
As mentioned earlier, scores include scores across all procedures, across all time periods from effective_care,
and negative scores from readmissions, so both are factored into determining hospital quality.
We take the average in order to normalize for number of procedures, and just focus on quality.

From visual inspection, we can see that none of the hospitals have just one or two procedures, so they all 
appear to be valid results for consistently high quality hospitals.
