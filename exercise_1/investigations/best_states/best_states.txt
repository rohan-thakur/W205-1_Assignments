States were ranked, similar to hospitals, in order of highest average score in order to determine the 10 best states.
As mentioned earlier, scores include scores across all procedures, across all time periods from effective_care,
and negative scores from readmissions, so both are factored into determining hospital quality across states.
We take the average in order to normalize for number of procedures, and just focus on quality.

From visual inspection, we can see that though states may have largely varying aggregate scores (which can certainly be attributed to size, population), 
they have a close ranking for consistently high hospital quality states.
