Results are listed in hospital_variability_results excel workbook.

Procedures have been ranked in terms of variability across hospitals, here calculated as the difference between
the maximum score achieved between hospitals and the minimum score achieved between hospitals. Once again, this 
includes scores from readmission as well as effective_care procedures. 

From the results, it appears that the procedures with greatest variability are generally measures of time taken
for various actions in hospitals.
