The hospitals_and_patients sql query is broken into two files in order to render answers for both questions asked.

As mentioned earlier, scores include scores across all procedures, across all time periods from effective_care,
and negative scores from readmissions, so both are factored into determining hospital quality.
We take the average across all scores for each hospital to determine its average score.
A hospital's variability is determined as the difference between maximum score achieved and minimum score achieved.


1. We find that there is a very weak negative correlation between average hospital quality scores and patient survey
   responses with an r of -0.1514. 

2. We find that there is a weak negative correlation between hospital variability scores and patient survey
   responses with an r of -0.2401
